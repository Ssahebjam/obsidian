this is when in side of a function we use exact same function imagine you want to find a key but the key is inside of a box now inside the box there are more smaller boxes which may have the key you can write a function that tells search the box if key was founded then get out but if there was another box i want you to repeat the same function i used to get here so the function will start again and open the box we found

in this function we have 2 parts{

1 => recursive case -> is when the part that function calls it self and we need to be careful that we dont go in a loop so we use a base case for not going in infint loop;

2 => base case -> is the part that the function is not calling it self again so we dont go in loop
}
