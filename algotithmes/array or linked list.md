arrays take memory that they are in next to each other the items are all together
when you want to add an item to a array maybe the next block of memory after it was taken
computer will need to move the hole items to a new place with enough space it takes time but they are after each other so its easier to read.

but linked list are each item points to next item so if you want to see next item you should go for previuse item look at the adress of the next item then go to the next item you wont have the problem with moving list but reading it is harder
